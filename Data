The geographical data are acquired through FourSqaure API. Since the API has limitation on number of calls, I will acquire
additional informatio on crime rate and wifi hotspot through Kaggle, which contains the longitude and latitude information. 

To get the crime rate of a particular area, I will count the number of crime over the area that is close to this spot. In 
particular, I will count the crimes happend here when the difference between two locations' longitude and latitude is small 
enough that it is below a certain threshold.
