The business problem here is to identify a location in New York to recommend someone who are operating a new Japanese 
restaurant business to open a new restaurant. 

To prove that this location is a good spot for restaurant, I will first explore the nearby restaurants and get 
customers' average ratings and tips. if the average is relatively high, I will consider this spot a good location 
for a new restaurant, since people here tend to give more tips and have great impression on this particular business area. 

In order to pick a best one out of several possible choices, I will compare features of different areas and choose the 
best one.
